                Please don’t arrive before 18:15. We do not have access to the lido
                until after 18:15; the lido car park will be packed with customers
                trying to leave.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>MEDICAL DECLARATION</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Please complete the health declaration online before you
                visit the registration tent and have the confirmation email available to
                show the Registration team if required. You will not receive a race
                number without a completed health declaration.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Please complete this beforehand to speed up your registration
                and for those around you.</strong></p>

        </p>
        <p><strong>PARKING</strong></p>
        <p>It is strongly recommended you park at Guildford Spectrum (free) and
            walk over to the Lido rear car overflow car park where Registration
            is.</p>
        <p>Parking is available in the main lido public car park and at the
            Bowling Green Car Park further up Lido Road. We advise sharing lifts if
            possible.</p>
        <p><strong>REGISTRATION</strong></p>
        <p>Registration will take place in the event village, which is in the
            overflow car park beside the lido.</p>
        <p><strong>If you are a member of British Triathlon please bring your
                membership card to registration</strong> and show it to the
            marshals.</p>
        <p>You will receive a coloured race number and wrist band. The colour of
            both indicates the race category. Please put the wrist band on straight
            away ON YOUR RIGHT WRIST, and attach the race number to the front of the
            shirt you will run in or a Race belt if using a TriSuit.</p>
        <p><strong>PHOTOGRAPHY</strong></p>
        <p>Parents / guardians / competitors who do not wish photos to be
            published of themselves or their children must let our registration team
            know when they collect their race number. The marshals will give you a
            pink ‘No Photos’ wristband which must also be secured on your RIGHT
            WRIST. <strong>Competitors who do not have photo consent must wear this
                ‘No Photos’ pink wristband to prevent photos being published of these
                individuals.</strong> Parents and spectators are reminded any photos you
            take including others not to share them on social media.</p>
        <p>Photographs are taken on best endeavours and made available to
            download a week or two after the event when vetted.</p>
        <p><strong>Photographs are taken on the last bend before the finish.
                SMILE!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>RACE TIMING</strong></p>
        <p>When you register, you will be given a paper race number. Attach this
            to the front of the shirt you will run in using safety pins provided or
            you can also use a race belt if you prefer. <strong>Marshals will help
                write your race number in large numbers on both upper arms using a
                marker.</strong></p>
        <p>Race timing is performed by marshals using an app. If your race
            number is hard to read (especially when you are running past quickly!),
            the marshals may not be able to correctly identify you and you may miss
            a timing split. Please be sympathetic with the marshals, they’re all
            volunteers and it can be quite difficult to read lots of race numbers
            quickly.</p>
        <p>If something isn’t clear with the timing, please ask the marshals at
            the registration tent who will be able to explain again.</p>
        <p><strong>TRANSITION</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Your upper body must be covered before you leave transition.
                Trisuits are acceptable. Don’t forget to have your race number clearly
                on display, or you won’t get a race time!</strong></p>
        <p>There is one transition area for Tristar competitors, and another for
            the Youth &amp; Junior and Adult race. Access to these areas will open
            at around 18:35, and close again shortly before the race briefing at
            19:00.</p>
        <p>Please minimise the amount of kit you take into transition because
            space is limited. You shouldn’t need much more than a towel, running
            shoes, socks, shirt, shorts and a bottle of water. Please neatly arrange
            your things in a small square on the ground and leave access routes for
            other competitors to get to their belongings.</p>
        <p>You will not be allowed back into the transition areas until after
            all the competitors have finished racing, so if you want towels or dry
            robes etc. for after the race then please leave them outside the
            transition area.</p>
        <p><strong>SPECTATORS</strong></p>
        <p>We welcome all parents, guardians, family and friends to watch and
            support the competitors in their race. Excellent viewing areas are on
            the poolside grass banks and near the transition area or finish line.
            Please make sure you are aware of the general rules and the photography
            rules. To ensure the safety of our competitors, only competitors and
            marshals will be allowed at pool-side and in transition during the race.
            There will be plenty of friendly marshals to help the children.</p>
        <p>Please, no running alongside and/or screaming at children in
            transition (hearty encouragement only); it’s their race, win or lose.
            Any running alongside children or entering transition during the race
            will incur a time penalty for that athlete.</p>

            course. Children aged 15 to 19 in the Youth &amp; Junior category will

        <p>Adults and Youth &amp; Junior competitors will be pooled, so that the
            slowest from both categories start first, with the faster competitors
            starting later. As with the children, there will be a suitable gap
            between competitors, or longer if the marshals on the poolside deem it
            appropriate to spread people out more for the longer swim.</p>

        <p><img src="../assets/images/run_route.png" style="width:6.93855in;height:3.36766in" /></p>
        <p>The run routes are signposted with large, black arrows on a yellow
            background. On the children’s course, marshals are spaced regularly
            along the route so that competitors are always within view.</p>
        <p>The turn-around points are marked with large signs. The colour of the
            sign matches the colour of the race numbers and wristbands for that
            category. There will also be a marshal at each turn-around point.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Run Finish</u></strong></p>
        <p>We will operate a funnel system (like Parkrun) at the finish line
            where you captured time is then correlated with your position. You must
            not exit the funnel until the Marshal has completed the timing
            actions.</p>
        <p>You must not overtake or change positions in the funnel.</p>
        <p><strong>MEDICAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Please ensure you have filled in the medical declaration
                before you collect your race number.</strong></p>
        <p>Our event medical team from Team Medic will be on standby for any
            first aid or medical treatment. Their main treatment facility will be
            located at the finish line and medical teams will be stationed or mobile
            at various places on the course.</p>
        <p><strong>Do not compete if you feel unwell or have recently been
                unwell.</strong> This advice applies even if you are raising money for
            charity. If you feel feverish, have had diarrhoea or been vomiting or
            had any chest pains <strong>DO NOT RACE!</strong> Many medical
            emergencies occur because people have been unwell but do not want to
            miss the event. If you have a family history of heart disease or sudden
            death or have any symptoms of possible heart disease, i.e. chest pain
            during exercise, sudden shortness of breath, or rapid palpitations, you
            should see your GP who can arrange for you to have a proper cardiac
            assessment.</p>
        <p><strong>RACE RULES</strong></p>
        <p>The Phoenix Aquathlon races are governed by British Triathlon and
            thus British Triathlon rules apply. The most up-to-date rules can be
